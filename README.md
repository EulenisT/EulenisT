## About me

Hi! Welcome to my GitHub. I'm a student in 3rd year of computer science with a specialization in application development. 

I have developed several projects in different programming languages, all in a strictly academic environment. I feel strongly attracted to web development, specifically front-end design and development. With intentions to expand my knowledge to mobile development. My goal is to be able to keep learning every day in the world of computer science.
